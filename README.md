# **Traffic Sign Recognition**

**Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project #2**

2017/7/10

## Overview

This project processes a German road sign dataset and trains a **TensorFlow neural network** to classify each sign image.  The network architecture uses **convolution** and **fully connected layers** to achieve **~95% prediction accuracy**.  Five additional sign images found by Google Maps are also processed to demonstrate an example of real world application and investigate its accuracy and performance.
