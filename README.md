# **Traffic Sign Recognition**

**Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project #2**

2017/7/10

## Overview

This project processes a German road sign dataset and trains a **TensorFlow neural network** to classify each sign image.  The network architecture uses **convolution** and **fully connected layers** to achieve **~95% prediction accuracy**.  Five additional sign images found by Google Maps are also processed to demonstrate an example of real world application and investigate its accuracy and performance.

For more details about the results of this activity, see the [project writeup document](writeup_P2.md).

## How to Run Code

1. Set up [Udacity Self-Driving Car Term 1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) environment (Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, TensorFlow)

2. Open the IPython notebook "Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynbs" using Jupyter, and execute all cells.
